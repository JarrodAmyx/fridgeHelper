# Fridge Manager

Introducing our innovative fridge management system, designed to make the daily task of managing the contents of a fridge effortless and efficient for every member of a household. With our system, users can easily manage one fridge and its several sections, including shelves, doors, produce sections, and an integrated freezer.

## Introduction
Our system provides users with the ability to create accounts, complete with their name, picture, and contact email, and customize their preferences by setting the amount of space they are permitted to use in each fridge section. With an extensive database containing physical dimensions and food types for at least 10 common food items, users can easily add new items with expiration dates and handling recommendations.

Our fridge management system has various features to manage space, expiration dates, and other attributes, such as providing reminders when an item's expiration date is approaching, reached, or exceeded. The system also alerts users when the available space in the fridge is running low, prompting them to remove an item before depositing another.
